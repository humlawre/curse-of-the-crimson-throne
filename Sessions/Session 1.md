# Scene 1

The city of Korvosa is a enormous sprawl. From a distance, its grand architecture is a mosaic of stone and tile, but today it is veiled by a thin, cold rain. The sky, a bruised gray, weeps over the haughty spires of [[Castle Korvosa]] and the [[Great Bridge of Size]], which arcs over the [[Jeggare River]] like a sodden, immense spine. Up close, in the fading light of evening, the city reveals its true nature. The air, heavy with the scent of wet stone and waste, clings to the cobblestone streets. Hushed conversations and nervous glances replace the day’s boisterous commerce as a palpable tension settles over the districts. The city, a colony of the vast [[Cheliax|Chelish Empire]], is a place of stark contrasts—of gilded balconies overlooking grimy slums, of strict law enforced with a brutality that breeds resentment. It is a city holding its breath under a steady downpour, waiting for a final, discordant note to shatter its fragile peace.

# The Summons
## Scene 2: Riven
The rain drums soft against the eaves of the tenement’s slate roof. **[[Riven Drex]]** sits alone in a narrow garret (attic), lit by a single lantern — oil-fed, clean-burning. A low table is spread with gear: a curved black blade, half-disassembled for maintenance. A blank-bound book lies nearby, its pages filled with angular Elven script. A list. The ink is iron-black, the calligraphy precise. Names. Dates. Locations.

At the very top: **G. Lamm**.

He works like a surgeon. Silent. Exact. The disassembled focus gem hums with quiet menace as he inspects it. Then something shifts.

Not sound. Not motion.

**Presence**.

He blinks once. Looks down. At the center of the table — laid directly atop the open kill log — is a card.

No scent. No disturbance. No weight. Just **there**.

Not there a second ago. Now in perfect alignment with the margin of the page.

He doesn’t reach for it. Not yet. He studies it — front first. **The Eclipse**. A harrow card aligned with ambition through shadow. Intelligence and evil. A symbol of hidden power, of secrets weaponized.

It fits.

He flips it.

On the back, in bold black ink, carefully written:

> _I know what Gaedren has done to you. He has wronged me as well. I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him. Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there. Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done._

He reads it twice. Then a third time. He doesn’t frown. Doesn’t curse. Instead, he turns to the logbook, retrieves a black quill, and beneath Lamm’s name, writes a new line:

> **Location confirmed. Probable trap. Acceptable risk.**

He slides the card into the book and seals it.

Then he assembles his sword with the same meticulous care a butcher might give to sharpening a cleaver. Riven finds some fresh meat.

## Scene 3: Lucious
The bells of [[Grand Cathedral of Pharasma]] toll low over Korvosa, the sound rolling through the marble halls like distant thunder. **[[Lucious Vale]]** kneels alone in a candlelit alcove, the air heavy with incense and the quiet rustle of silk robes from the main nave.

Before him rests a silver bowl of sanctified water. His reflection stares back — calm, unreadable, the mask of a dutiful initiate. To anyone who might pass, he is a man deep in prayer to the **[[Pharasma|Lady of Graves]]**.

Today's prayers take longer to come. Something is bothering him. Something catches his eye.

The reflection changes.

Floating in the bowl is a harrow card, face up. **The Mute Hag** — wisdom in silence, the keeper of terrible truths. Its ink is crisp, unmarred by age, and not wet despite the water surrounding it.

Lucious blinks. The card is gone from the bowl.

He looks down.

It’s in his hand.

He doesn’t remember moving. Doesn’t remember touching the water. But it is there all the same, the edges warm as if held moments before by someone else.

On the back, in neat, confident script:

> _I know what Gaedren has done to you. He has wronged me as well. I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him. Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there. Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done._

His thumb brushes the words slowly, as if tasting the ink through touch. The card disappears into the folds of his robe, hidden alongside the other tools of his trade.

Lucious lowers his head again toward the silver bowl, his reflection staring back at him with a faint, cold smile.

“Justice,” he murmurs under his breath.

## Scene 4: Cassian
The sounds of the city's underbelly are a familiar music to **[[Cassian Veylance]]**—the Prince of the Gutter. The crash of a dropped bottle, the slosh of rain in an alleyway, and the hushed, nervous laughter of those trying to escape the evening curfew. Once, he was meant for grander things, for the polished floors of a manor and the whispers of a courtly life. That was before Gaedren Lamm spun his web of lies, before his father's false accusation led to the gallows and the Veylance name was erased from Korvosa's history.

Now, Cassian is a different sort of nobleman. A quick smile and a silver tongue are his family crest. He holds a rapier, not a scepter, and his throne is the streets. The name "The Laughing Blade" is whispered in hushed tones by those who have seen him fight, a dance of steel and scorn that always ends with him standing victorious.

He leans against a stone wall, watching the street, a sly grin playing on his lips as he listens to the rain. A sudden flash of light catches his eye, not from a lamplight, but from something in his own hand. He looks down. A card.

He has no memory of picking it up.

It is a harrow card—**The Brass Dwarf**. A card representing pride and defiance in the face of insurmountable odds. It fits him like a second skin, a defiant laugh in the face of his family's ruin. He flips it over with a practiced flourish, his smile fading as he reads the confident, sharp script.

> _I know what Gaedren has done to you. He has wronged me as well. I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him. Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there. Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done._

Cassian reads the note once, his thumb tracing the bold black ink. He reads it again, his lips curling into a more dangerous, less charming smile. Gaedren Lamm. The name is a poison in his mouth, a stain on his family's honor. He tucks the card into his vest pocket, right beside his heart. The laughter is gone for now, replaced by the quiet, cold resolve of a man with nothing left to lose. He will go. Not for justice, but for the satisfaction of seeing his family's betrayer brought to his knees.

---

You stand outside this home at 3 Lancet Street, drawn here by the mysterious summons. The cards you received, **The Eclipse** and **The Mute Hag**, and the **The Brass Dwarf** each held a specific meaning for you, but the message on their back was identical. It spoke to your deepest, darkest wound, a promise of vengeance against **[[Gaedren Lamm]]**, the man who has personally wronged you both.

A single, flickering light spills from the home's window. The front door is ajar. You step inside and find yourselves in a single cozy chamber. A fragrant haze of flowers and strong spice hangs in the air, a product of several sticks of incense smoldering in wall-mounted burners shaped like butterfly-winged elves. The smoke gives the room a dreamy feel, as if reality itself is just a whisper here.

The walls are draped with heavy brocaded tapestries. One shows a black-skulled beast juggling human hearts, while another depicts a pair of angels dancing atop a snow-blasted mountain. A third, on the far wall, displays a tall, hooded figure shrouded in mist, holding a flaming sword in a skeletal hand. Brightly colored rugs cover the floor, but the room’s only furnishings are a wooden table covered by a bright red throw cloth and several elegant, tall-backed chairs. A basket covered by blue cloth sits under the table.

On the table itself, a simple note waits, held down by a smooth, river-worn stone. The bold black ink on the paper matches the script on the back of your Harrow cards. The words are crisp and clear:

> _He has wronged me as well, yet I cannot strike at him. Find him in the ancient Fishery, on the northern bank of the Jeggare River, near the docks of Endrin’s Folly.
> 
> Others like you will be there. Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done._

The handwriting is confident and sharp. It's a statement, not a request. The note is not signed. It does not need to be. The promise of justice against Gaedren Lamm is all the signature it needs.

# Scene 5

As you do, the front door, which was ajar, creaks open a bit wider, and an attractive middle-aged [[Varisia|Varisian]] woman enters the home. She has long, dark hair streaked with silver and her eyes, though ancient, are sharp and seem to take in each of you in an instant. She greets you with a warm smile.

"Thank you for coming, my friends, and for putting up with my unconventional method of contacting you," she says, her voice soft but clear. She takes a seat at the table. "I have reason to remain hidden, you see—a vicious man would see great harm done to me if he knew I was reaching out for help. This man has done something terrible to each of you as well. I speak, of course, of Gaedren Lamm, a man whose cruelty and capacity to destroy the lives of those he touches are matched only by his gift for avoiding reprisal."

She produces a harrow deck from a pocket, idly shuffling the cards. Her skill with the deck is obvious; the cards seem to float and dance through her fingers.

"You see, a year ago, his thieves stole this, my harrow deck, from me. It is important to me, an heirloom passed down through a dozen generations, and also my sole means of support. When Lamm’s pickpockets stole it, my son Eran tracked them down and returned my deck to me. But Gaedren had him followed, and soon after he left my home, Gaedren’s thugs murdered him. I sought help from the Korvosan Guard, but they turned me away. And so I asked around. I paid bribes. I consulted my harrow deck for advice. And recently, I was rewarded—I found out where Gaedren dwells. He can be found in an old fishery north of here, at Westpier 17, where he trains abducted children to be pickpockets and counts his stolen treasures.

“But I need your help. I cannot hope to face this man on my own, and the Guard moves so slowly that if they were willing to help, Gaedren would certainly know of their coming well in advance. And even if they arrested him, what guarantee would I have he would be punished? This criminal has evaded the law for decades. But you know of these frustrations as well, for word on the street has it that Gaedren has wronged each of you, too. So there we are. It is time for him to pay.”

# Scene 6: Harrow Reading

### Event 1: A Return to Zellara’s Home
**Harrow Card: The Crows**
**Reasoning:** The Crows represent a terrible fate and a grim outcome. The PCs return to Zellara's home only to find her severed head, revealing a terrible fate that has already befallen her and that their mission was guided by a spectral figure.
**Reading**: *"The path of justice is not a straight road, and your way forward will be a twisting journey over the bones of the city. The roof of the world will be your guide, and the wind will be your only company."*
### Event 2: The Mysterious Brooch
**Harrow Card: The Hidden Truth**
**Reasoning:** This card represents a secret, a hidden fact, or a lie that is uncovered. The brooch is not just a gift; it is a sign of Zellara's true nature as a spectral entity, and it reveals a hidden truth about the magical nature of her summons.
**Reading**: *"Not every gift is what it seems. A small token of thanks will reveal a truth hidden in plain sight, a secret held by the dead that you alone can claim."*
**Reading**: *"The path of justice is not a straight road, and your way forward will be a twisting journey over the bones of the city. The roof of the world will be your guide, and the wind will be your only company."*
### Event 3: Mad Prophet
**Harrow Card: The Mute Hag**
**Reasoning:** The Mute Hag represents a hidden or terrible truth. The mad prophet, while seemingly nonsensical, is actually providing cryptic clues about future events and the city's fate, a truth that is difficult for most to understand.
**Reading**: *"The truth will be spoken, but not in words you understand. A voice in the city will scream of coming doom, and in its madness, you will find a terrible truth that is not meant for mortal ears."*
### Event 4: Imps and Dragons
**Harrow Card: The Avalanche
**Reasoning:** This card represents entanglement, obstacles, and a difficult path. The imps and dragons terrorizing the city present a new, chaotic obstacle for the PCs to overcome.
**Reading**: *"The sky will rain with chaos and fire, and the earth will tremble. A great force of nature, long dormant, will awaken. You must stand against the coming avalanche, or be buried beneath it."*
### Event 5: Meet the Mob
**Harrow Card: The Liar**
**Reasoning:** The Liar represents deceit, betrayal, and a false front. A mob, while appearing as a unified force of public will, is often driven by manipulation and can be a false representation of justice, leading the PCs to a difficult choice.
**Reading**: *"Justice will wear a thousand faces, but the truest one will be hidden behind a mask of fury. The crowd will call for blood, but their rage is a lie told by others. Do not be fooled by their angry smiles."*
### Event 6: Drunken Guard
**Harrow Card: The Betrayal**
**Reasoning:** The Betrayal represents broken loyalty and a friend turned foe. A member of the Korvosan Guard, meant to be a figure of law and order, challenges the PCs to a duel, representing the breakdown of the city's institutions and the betrayal of public trust.
**Reading**: *"The very law will turn on you, a friend's uniform now a foe's armor. The city's protectors will fall, and their weakness will be a wound that you must tend to."*
### Event 7: Otyugh Uprising
**Harrow Card: The Cyclone**
**Reasoning:** The Cyclone represents uncontrollable chaos and unpredictable forces. The otyugh bursting through the streets from the sewers is a force of nature that cannot be reasoned with, a symbol of the city's descent into pure chaos.
**Reading**: *"The sewers will weep, and their tears will bring a tide of chaos. A storm will rage from below, a maelstrom of filth and fury that will remind you that this city is not a place for the weak."*
### Event 8: Long Live the Queen!
**Harrow Card: The Tyrant**
**Reasoning:** The Tyrant represents oppressive rule and a new, often unjust, authority. This event directly shows the public's defiance of the new Queen's rule, a testament to her oppressive nature and her lack of a legitimate claim to the throne in the eyes of the people.
**Reading**: *"The shouts of a new queen will be a roar of thunder, and the shouts of the people will be a whisper of rain. You will witness the rise of a new evil, and you will know that the crown is a curse for the one who wears it."*
### Event 9: Welcome to the Guard
**Harrow Card: The Keep**
**Reasoning:** The Keep represents safety, protection, and a new home. By being welcomed into the Guard, the PCs are given a new, seemingly safe role and purpose, a stark contrast to the chaos of the city.
**Reading**: *"The city's walls will open to you, offering a fragile shelter in a storm. You will find a new home in the heart of the law, but remember that even a fortress can be a cage."*
### Event 10: The Ambassador’s Secret
**Harrow Card: The Sickness**
**Reasoning:** The ambassador's secret is a form of political corruption that is infecting the city's power structure. The PCs are tasked with uncovering this secret, which is essentially exposing a form of "sickness" in the city's government.
**Reading**: *"A noble's life is a web of secrets, and you will pull a thread that unravels a great misfortune. You will be asked to clean up the mess of the powerful, and your reward will be a new burden."*
### Event 11: The Queen's Scapegoat
**Harrow Card: The Eclipse**
**Reasoning:** The Eclipse is a card of ambition through shadow and a symbol of secrets weaponized. Queen Ileosa uses the fabricated lie about Trinia Sabor to consolidate her power, weaponizing a lie to achieve her goals.
**Reading**: *"The sun will be swallowed by a lie, and a new shadow will fall over Korvosa. A woman's name will be whispered as the cause of all ill, but her fate is merely a shadow play for a greater ambition."*
### Event 12: Into the Shingles
**Harrow Card: The Teamster**
**Reasoning:** The Teamster represents a difficult journey and overcoming a series of obstacles. The PCs are forced to navigate the treacherous rooftops of Korvosa, facing various dangers along the way to reach their destination.
**Reading**: *"The path of justice is not a straight road, and your way forward will be a twisting journey over the bones of the city. The roof of the world will be your guide, and the wind will be your only company."*
### Event 13: A Missing Body
**Harrow Card: The Empty Throne**
**Reasoning:** The Empty Throne represents a vacuum of power, loss, and a lack of authority. The missing body of a respected Shoanti man creates a power vacuum and the potential for conflict between two groups, a direct result of the city's instability.
**Reading**: *"Even the dead cannot find peace in a city gone mad. A stolen body will create a chasm between two peoples, a void where a king once stood, and you will be the only ones who can fill it."*
### Event 14: A Lovely Day For An Execution
**Harrow Card: The Betrayal**
**Reasoning:** The Betrayal represents a broken promise and an unjust fate. Queen Ileosa's public execution of Trinia Sabor is a betrayal of the city's justice system and a public display of her tyrannical power, forcing the PCs to decide whether to intervene.
**Reading**: *"The promise of justice will be a beautiful lie. The city will cheer a murderer, but the true act of betrayal will be a public spectacle. The world will watch as a tyrant claims her power, but only you can choose to disrupt the script."*
