# Varisia: The Land of a Thousand Wonders

Varisia is a large, rugged, and somewhat untamed frontier region. It is a land of rolling hills, dense forests, and towering, ancient monuments left behind by a forgotten empire. Its people are not a single, unified group, but rather a mix of distinct cultures.

**Varisia's Real-World Similarities:**

- **Geography:** Varisia's geography, with its misty forests, rugged coastline, and a massive cliff-face known as the Storval Rise, has been compared to the American Northwest, particularly the Oregon coast.

- **The Varisian People:** The nomadic, traveling Varisian ethnicity, with their colorful caravans, love of music and performance, and tradition of fortune-telling (using the Harrow deck), are a clear fantasy analog to the Romani people (sometimes referred to as "Gypsies," though this term can be considered a slur). It's a point of some discussion within the community on how to best portray them without falling into harmful stereotypes.

- **The Shoanti:** The native, tribal people of Varisia, the Shoanti, are fierce warriors divided into seven clans, or _quahs_, each with its own customs, territories, and totems. Their warrior culture, distinctive tattoos, and struggle against encroaching colonists have strong parallels to various Native American tribes.

- **The "Colonists":** Many of the major cities in Varisia, including Korvosa, were founded by colonists from the imperialistic nation of **Cheliax**. This creates a dynamic of a young, expanding colonial culture clashing with the traditions of the native Varisian and Shoanti peoples. This is a common theme in real-world history.

### Korvosa: A City of Fidelity and Strength

Korvosa is the largest city in Varisia and the primary setting for _Curse of the Crimson Throne_. It is a city of stark contrasts: a beautiful, well-ordered cityscape built on a foundation of political corruption, social inequality, and a dark history.

**Korvosa's Real-World Similarities:**

- **Founding & Culture:** Korvosa was founded as a military fort and colony of the infernally-influenced empire of **Cheliax**. Its culture is a reflection of this heritage: highly structured, lawful, and a bit rigid, with a strong emphasis on tradition, military order (the Korvosan Guard and Sable Company), and a rigid social hierarchy. This has led many to compare Korvosa to a number of historical cities:

    - **Imperial Rome:** The focus on law, hierarchy, and a strong sense of imperial heritage, despite being a colony, evokes a feeling of the Roman Empire.

    - **Victorian London:** The city has a distinct "old-world" feel, with a visible divide between the wealthy elite and the struggling commoners. The presence of social issues like crime lords, vigilantism, and public hangings also fits this aesthetic.

    - **Byzantine Empire:** Some have drawn parallels to a far-flung, decadent provincial city of the Byzantine Empireâ€”a place that clings to the old ways of a fading empire while struggling with its own internal strife.

- **Class Division:** Korvosa is known for its stark class divisions, with the rich living in opulent districts on the hills and the poor and disenfranchised dwelling in the "Shingles" (a shantytown built on the city's rooftops) or the sewers of Old Korvosa. This is a classic real-world urban problem that has existed throughout history.

- **Relationship with Other Groups:** Korvosa has a strained and often violent relationship with the native Shoanti, whom the Korvosans displaced and view as "barbarians." This reflects real-world colonial tensions and prejudice. The city also has a significant population of the nomadic Varisians, who are often relegated to slums and face discrimination.

In summary, **Varisia** is a blend of rugged American frontier and Native American-inspired cultures, with a nomadic people that evokes the Romani. **Korvosa** is a city-state that feels like a cross between a rigidly lawful Roman outpost and a dark, class-divided Victorian city, all struggling with its own colonial legacy and internal decay.
