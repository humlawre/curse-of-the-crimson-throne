As a child, you spent a lot of time in the Shingles, the interconnected rooftops that span much of Korvosa. You are particularly adept at climbing, jumping, and avoiding falls.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Acrobatic

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Climb and Jump checks, and may take 10 on Climb checks even when distracted. If you fall, you automatically reduce the damage taken by the fall by one die, as if you had fallen 10 less feet. This reduction in damage stacks with the Jump and Tumble checks to further reduce falling damage.
