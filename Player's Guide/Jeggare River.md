Named for Montlarion Jeggare, the Jeggare River plays a vital role in southern Varisia. The river flows from the Mindspin Mountains into Conqueror's Bay, and at its mouth it is split by Endrin Isle and the city of Korvosa. Before the Chelaxian invasion of the land, the native Shoanti called the river Mashkapikki.

The headwaters of the river are known for their plentiful supply of salmon, with which the Korvosans fill both their stomachs and their pockets as one of the city's major exports. The river is also known to empty into the most prosperous clam field in Varisia: the Narrows of St. Alika.     asdsdasdads
