# History and Government
Korvosa was founded as a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colony but has since become an independent city-state within the [[Varisia|Varisian region]]. It is known for its rigid, stratified social structure and a deeply ingrained aristocracy. The city is ruled by a monarchy, which is supposedly plagued by an infamous superstition known as the Curse of the Crimson Throne, a legend that claims no monarch of Korvosa will ever die of old age or produce an heir. The current king is the latest victim of this curse, leading to a state of near-anarchy.

Korvosa is the eldest of Varisia's three city-states, once part of Imperial Cheliax but now independent. The settlement originally served as no more than a defensive position from which settlers and explorers would enter Varisia, only growing into the cosmopolitan center of trade that it is today with the passage of time and events.
## Founding
Before the arrival of the Empire of Cheliax, Korvosa was a site sacred to the [[Shoanti]]. The location, which included an ancient Thassilonian flat-topped pyramid called the Grand Mastaba, was of great importance to them, even though they had forgotten **what they were protecting**. In 4407 AR, a group of Chelaxian marines under the command of Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa selected the site to begin construction of a defensive outpost. Once completed, Fort Korvosa acted as a common stop for explorers, settlers, and trappers operating in the region. The trading post and its wooden defenses were replaced by stone and mortar ones in 4438 AR after a Shoanti raiding force burned much of the location in 4429 AR in what would become known as the Great Fire.
# Institutions
The city's institutions are characterized by their strict and often brutal enforcement of law and order, which in turn breeds resentment among the populace.

- **The Korvosan Guard**: The city's primary military and law enforcement body. They are known for their slow-moving bureaucracy, which often allows criminals to evade justice.

- **The Crown**: The monarchy is a central institution, though the "curse" on its leaders makes it a source of political instability. The queen, [[Ileosa Arabasti]], has recently taken control after the king's death, and her actions are central to the adventure's plot.

- **Criminal Underworld**: The city has a pervasive criminal element. The documents mention Gaedren Lamm as a prime example, a man whose ability to avoid reprisal is legendary.

# Everyday Life
Everyday life in Korvosa is one of stark contrasts. Grand architecture and gilded balconies coexist with grimy slums and a pervasive air of tension. The city is veiled by a cold rain and a palpable sense of unease. The population is diverse, and the city has seven districts, each with its own character. The documents describe a city where hushed conversations and nervous glances have replaced the day's commerce, and the air is heavy with the scent of wet stone and waste.

# Real-world comparison
Korvosa's history as a colony, its rigid social hierarchy, and its grand but decaying architecture can be compared to a city like Venice during its decline, or perhaps a fantastical version of Victorian London, with its stark class divides and undercurrent of social tension and crime.
