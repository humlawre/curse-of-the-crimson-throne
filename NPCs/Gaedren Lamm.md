Gaedren Lamm is a minor crimelord in [[Korvosa]] who abducted orphans and street urchins for decades. Calling them his 'Little Lamms', he forced them to commit petty crimes to support him and his organization.

While a large portion of Korvosa's lower classes had dealings with Lamm, most of the city's middle class and nobility were not even aware of his existence. For most of his life it seemed that no matter what he did, he was never called to answer for his crimes. This ended in 4708 AR, when he was killed by persons unknown.
