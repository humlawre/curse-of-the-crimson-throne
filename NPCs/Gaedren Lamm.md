Gaedren Lamm was a minor crimelord in [[Korvosa Notes]] who abducted orphans and street urchins for decades. Calling them his 'Little Lamms', he forced them to commit petty crimes to support him and his organization.

While a large portion of Korvosa's lower classes had dealings with Lamm, most of the city's middle class and nobility were not even aware of his existence. For most of his life it seemed that no matter what he did, he was never called to answer for his crimes. This ended in 4708 AR, when he was killed by persons unknown.

# Relatives
Rolth Lamm is one of Gaedren's sons. Gaedren frequently abused Rolth, who repeatedly ran away before being recaptured by Gaedren each time. This cycle repeated until Rolth learned a spell that dealt Gaedren so much harm that it deterred any further attempts at retrieval.
