# Campaign Synopsis
Curse of the Crimson Throne begins as a group of diverse characters are drawn together to seek revenge on [[Gaedren Lamm]], a man whose destructive influence has impacted each of their lives in different ways. Yet with revenge against the aged crime lord complete, the PCs find their city plunged into chaos: the king has died, and the queen, a petulant, spoiled schemer named [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa]], now rules [[Korvosa]]!

Recruited by the Korvosan Guard, the PCs work to bring stability back to the city. During the course of several missions, they begin to uncover evidence that Queen Ileosa may not have the best intentions for Korvosa, but it isn’t until a devastating disease called [[blood veil]] breaks out in the city that these rumors become fact. After helping to save Korvosa from the virulent plague, the PCs discover direct links between the queen and the troubles afflicting Korvosa, yet her plans remain nebulous.

A trip to a quarantined portion of the city reveals several awful truths, foremost among them that Queen Ileosa has acquired a powerful artifact, the [[Crown of Fangs]], crafted from the teeth of an ancient dragon named [[Kazavon]]. The PCs must travel beyond Korvosa’s walls into the dangerous wilds of the [[Cinderlands]]. There, after earning the trust of that region’s natives, the [[Shoanti]], the PCs learn the truth: Queen Ileosa has assumed the mantle of the long-dead Kazavon, and only the sacred blade that originally slew the dragon so long ago can secure the mad queen’s defeat.

After recovering the magical sword from the depths of a legendary and devastatingly haunted fortress, [[Castle Scarwall]], the party returns to Korvosa to face Queen Ileosa. Pursuing her to an ancient pyramid called the [[Sunken Queen]], they must confront Ileosa and her most powerful minions before she can employ an artifact used by one of the runelords of ancient Thassilon to sacrifice thousands for her own immortality!
