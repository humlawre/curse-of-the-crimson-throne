Born into a respected elven scholarly family in Korvosa, Riven Drex was meant to attend the [[Acadamae]] as a magical prodigy. But before his training truly began, he was abducted by [[Gaedren Lamm]]’s thugs, sold into the gutters, and disappeared into the “Little Lamms.” There, Lamm realized Riven had potential. The boy was handed over to an underground faction with ties to secret magical conditioning — a failed black-budget experiment to train living arcane weapons. Riven didn’t break. He learned. Escaped. Survived. Perfected his craft. Now, years later, he has returned to Korvosa, not as a child, but as a cold, methodical spell-swordsman. His goal isn’t justice. It’s eradication — of Lamm, of rot, of weakness. He has a list. Gaedren’s at the top. The rest can pray for alphabetical mercy.
