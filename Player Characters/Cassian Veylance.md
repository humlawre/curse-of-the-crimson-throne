Once, my family’s name carried weight in [[Korvosa Notes]]’s courts. Then [[Gaedren Lamm]] came along, spun up some lies about my father murdering a priest of [[Sarenrae]], and watched the city tear us apart. My father took the noose, my kin the grave, and I? I got the streets. Learned fast that a quick tongue and quicker smile can open more doors than any lockpick. So, hunger fades but vengeance does not. I’ve traded rags for a rapier, and pity for cunning. I’ll toast with strangers, laugh with liars, and waltz my way out of trouble, but every clever word and every duel I win brings me one step closer to the day I look Lamm in the eye. Gaedren Lamm took everything from me. One day soon, I’ll return the favor.
