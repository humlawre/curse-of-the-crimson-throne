Abandoned at a young age under unknown and desperate circumstances, Lucious was left at a Korvosan orphanage with nothing to his name. Whispers among the caretakers hinted at strange circumstances surrounding his arrival, but no answers were ever given. Life at the orphanage was harsh, and Lucious quickly learned the value of secrets and connections, building a quiet network of friends and informants among the other children. Kate, a bright and kind-hearted girl, became his closest companion — until her sudden and brutal murder shattered his world. The reasons were hidden, the killer unpunished, and the truth smothered under lies. Lucious prayed for justice until his prayers turned dark, consumed by the need for vengeance. It was then Calistria, the goddess of revenge and subtlety, answered. Her whisper promised him the tools to settle the debt in blood and deceit. To move freely and gain trust, Lucious adopted the guise of a distant Pharasma devotee, allowing him access to the church’s halls and the ears of the pious. Behind this façade, he serves [[Calistria]]’s will, sharpening his skills in subterfuge and manipulation. His life is now a careful balance of masks and daggers — every step calculated toward the day he avenges Kate and uncovers the truth of his own origins.

Kate's disappearance is linked to [[Gaedren Lamm]].
